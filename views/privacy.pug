        h1 Privacy Policy
        p
            | Safe Browse for Slack operates the Safe Browse Slack application and safebrowse.io website,
            | which provide a url checking service and an overview of its use, respectively.
            | This page informs visitors of our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            | Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
            | If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.
            | The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing and improving our Service.
            | We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

        p 
            | Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the 
            a(title="Privacy Policy Template" href="https://www.privacypolicytemplate.net") Privacy Policy Template
            | .
        p

            a(title="Slack privacy policy" href="https://slack.com/privacy-policy") Slack Privacy Policy
            |  still applies when using the Safe Browse for Slack application.

        h2 Information Collection and Use
        p 
            | When using the Safe Browse Slack application, we access the message's text, the user's Slack User ID, and any meta-data provided by Slack.
            | Any web addresses shared within the message's text may be tracked and temporarily stored, as described below. The remaining information is immediately discarded.
        p
            | We use the 
            a(title="Google Safe Browsing" href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/") Google Safe Browsing Service 
            |  to inform users of threats previously reported on shared web addresses. Google tracks which web addresses are requested from the Safe Browsing Service.
            | This request is associated with our Service. It is not associated with the Slack User ID of the user who made the request.
            | Our Service uses an API version of the Safe Browsing Service that requires any results from their Service be temporarily stored by our Service.
            | This prevents unneccessary calls to their Service. Typical storage time is around five minutes. These stored web addresses are not associated with any
            | Personal Information from our Service's users.
        p If you choose to contact us, any Personal Information you provide will only be used to reply to your inquiry.

        h2 Cookies
        p 
            | Cookies are files with small amounts of data that are commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier.
            | Safe Browse for Slack does not use cookies.

        h2 Security
        p
            | We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
            | But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable;
            | we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        p 
            | Our Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
