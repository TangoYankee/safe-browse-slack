      hr
    p Slack recently added functionality to format hyperlinks within messages. 
      | Consequently, there are no plans to publish Markdownlinks to the Slack application libary. 
      | However, it is still be refactored and maintained to improve its architecture. 
      | Additionally, it is still available for installation in Slack workspaces. 
      | However, its availability is not continuously guaranteed.

      strike While Slack supports several ways to format messages, this does not include a way to cleanly format long web addresses.
      strike For example, there is no built-in way to shorten the directions to Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans: 
      | These are the directions to Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans
    ul

    p Rough, right?
      br

        | Markdown syntax

    h2 Steps
      hr
    ol
      li Begin your message with '/markdownlinks' to activate the command
      li Type in the message you want share
      li When you get to the text you want to hide your link behind, place it between brackets []
      li 
        | Immediately follow the text with the web address you want to hide, placed in paretheses ()  
        br 
        i Make sure there are no spaces between the closing bracket and the opening parenthesis!
      li Send your message and Markdownlinks will cleanly format the hyperlinks
        br
        i Other Slack formatting -such as emojis and strikethroughs- are preserved in the message
